               <h2>Our Certificates & Courses</h2>
               <p>We believe that learning is embedded in the relationships that you form and develop, whether with classmates and faculty members or with your experience of the natural world. Our community is small enough that you can know everyone and be known.
                <br>
                Youâ€™ll get many opportunities to bond and connect with your peers through various clubs and communities, extra-curricular activities and cultural fests. These interactions not only enhance the overall personality of our students, but are also essential for creating a well-balanced learning environment for them.
                <br><br>
                A home away from home, the campus offers many outlets of creative independence for students to pursue their interests and hobbies, while also providing opportunities to participate in community services. <br><br>
                People of this area desired that their children should get higher education in their own region, which was fulfilled after the opening of this college, providing economical and higher quality education as compared to private colleges of this area. This college is developing by leaps and bounds. Under the guidance of Punjabi university, Patiala and with creative thinking of the staff, this college is progressing towards newer stands of development. The only mission of this college is to create students that serve humanity, give society educated citizens, great sports-persons and hope to lead our society in various fields of development.</p>
